This week I'm very excited to be at ACCUConf, which is the second large conference I've attended since starting my career. My first conf was EuroLLVM in Edinburgh, where around twenty of my colleagues were there alongside me. This time I'm on my own in a city I don't know, so I'm looking forward to being forced to meet new people rather than having somewhere to hide and use as an excuse!

I'm going to be making notes on the talks which I attend, mostly for my own records, but hopefully others will find them useful too!

The conference runs over five days, the first of which is a set of day-long workshops. I decided to attend "A Programmer's Introduction to Chapel", as I have no experience in or knowledge of this language and am very interested in parallel computing.
