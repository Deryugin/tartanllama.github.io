We at [C++ Edinurgh][cpp-edinburgh-website] recently read a [blog post][stephanie-blog] by Stephanie Hulburt, which compiled a list of software engineers who would be willing to mentor others in a range of software and hardware areas. This gave us the idea to create something similar, though targeted at the Edinburgh C\+\+ community.

## C++ Edinburgh

C\+\+ Edinburgh is a meetup for C\+\+ professionals, students, graduates, hobbyists, and anyone else interested in learning more about the language. It was first started in March 2015 and so far has had 6 successful meetings, featuring a range of interesting talks and a great and growing turnout. We would like to take the opportunity to help our local C\+\+ community by creating a mentoring programme that will bring those looking for guidance together with experienced developers who are willing to share their knowledge.

## Our Goal

Our goal for this programme is to organise social events and hackathons to bring people together in the C\+\+ community, to bring together mentors and mentees and to help people learn and develop their skills. The first stage for this is to compile a list of C\+\+ software engineers who would be interested in mentoring or being mentored.

## Interested in Mentoring?

We are looking to compile a list of local C\+\+ developers in Edinburgh that would be willing to mentor. If you are interested in being on this list, simply get in touch with us either via [email][joe-email] or [twitter][joe-twitter]. All we need is a short bio, your area of experience and your contact details along with how you would prefer to be contacted. You bio doesn't have to be long, just something to tell people who you are and any skills, knowledge or experience you can share. We appreciate that not everyone would like to be contacted the same way, so if you tell us how you would like to be contacted then we can direct people looking for mentoring to you as you would prefer.

## Looking for a Mentor?

If you are looking for guidance, whether you are still a student, a recent graduate, a junior developer still trying to decide your career path, an experienced developer looking to move to something new, someone looking to get into C\+\+ or simply an enthusiast looking to do C\+\+ in your spare time, simply get in touch with us either via [email][joe-email]) or [twitter][joe-twitter]. All we need is a short bio and and the area(s) you are interested in guidance with.
