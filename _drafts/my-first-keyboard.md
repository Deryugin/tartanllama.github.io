I got my plates custom cut at [LaserMaster](http://www.lasermaster.co.uk/) in Cornwall, England. They were very responsive, helpful, and reasonably priced, so I'd recommend them if you're in the UK and looking for custom Aluminium plates. If you'd rather steel, you might want to check out [LaserGist](http://lasergist.com/), who seem to be even cheaper if you're just looking for a one-off.

For switches, I chose 67g R4 Zealios, which you can get from [ZealPC](https://zealpc.net/collections/group-buy-pre-orders/products/zealio). Shipping was pretty expensive to the UK, but I think it was worth it, as these are really incredible switches.

Here are the switches mounted snugly into the top plate. I was terrified that they wouldn't fit, but they clicked in perfectly.

I got to work with soldering my diodes to the switches. Here you can see my dodgy soldering and attempts to get the diodes bent into shape. This thing does actually work, trust me!

Here are the wires which I prepared for soldering. I somehow misplaced my wire strippers, so did this armed with just a box cutter. Would not recommend.

Here's a shot of all the diodes in place and the column wiring started.

All the columns are now wired! I was pretty pleased with how neat everything looked.

You can see at the bottom here where I had to get creative with getting the diodes to work without adding any extra wire in there. Don't worry, I did snip the ends off of them in the end.

Here's my first ever attempt at soldering a microcontroller. I had to redo some of these joints after taking this picture, but everything worked in the end.

Mmmmmm, spidery.

Here's all the wiring after I got the microcontroller in place. It took a lot of work to get those wires running underneath all of the diodes, but I think it was worth the effort. Maybe in the future I'll put them down beforehand to save the effort.

And here's the finished product! You can see where I had to cannibalize a keycap to get one of the right profile for my odd layout, and the keys in the top- and bottom-left are the wrong size or profile, but I'm pretty happy with the result.

For keyboard science.
