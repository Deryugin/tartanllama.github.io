The longer I've been working in the tech industry, the more I'm interested in the sociological issues as well as the technological. As such, I'm going to start writing a few posts on community, applying for jobs and such. Hopefully some of you will find them interesting, but if not, I'm happy to shout into a vacuum for your entertainment.

For my first post, I'd like to 

The easiest thing would have been for me to go and take some of the myriad sarcastic comments from a beginner-level Stack Overflow question. Instead, I went through some of my old Stack Overflow, Reddit and Hipchat comments and picked out real-life examples of times in the past when I've been a dick on the internet. 

> *Beginner posts basic Stack Overflow question*
>
> Me: At least make an attempt at this before posting for help.

> Beginner: Maybe this sounds like a stupid idea, but...
>
> Me: Yes, that does sound like a stupid idea.

> Colleague: TIL about Fluxx. It's cool that I can have a card game like this to play with my non-gamer friends.
>
> Me: Fluxx is everything wrong with board/card games.

> Beginner: I'm having some problems with this OpenGL program.
>
> Me: So you *want* to draw a shader when it has failed to load!? You need to think through the logic of your program. The if-statement in your question is triggered when the file can't be found, thus making the shader in a useless state. You then attempt to use this useless shader.

> Beginner: Why doesn't this code work?
>
> Me: Don't return a reference to a local temporary object.

> Beginner: Why is this a garbage value?
>
> Me: It's a garbage value because it doesn't mean anything in context.

Maybe you're reading those and thinking that they aren't all that bad. Maybe that would be the case in some contexts, but I know for a fact that some of these comments hurt people or turned people away from the community. That first one? The poster of the question never posted on SO again. The Fluxx one? He certainly never spoke to me about card games after that, even though I know for a fact that he was passionate about Magic.

I don't make any excuses for these contributions, or worse ones which have been lost down the back of the Internet sofa. But I *do* try and learn from them.
